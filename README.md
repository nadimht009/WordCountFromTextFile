# WordCountFromTextFile

This repository contains a Java program named "WordCountFromTextFile" that calculates the total number of words in a text file. It is a simple utility program designed to efficiently count words from a given text file.

Features:
- Input File: The program accepts any text file as input. In the provided code, it reads from a file named "nadim.txt", but this can be easily modified to read from any other text file.
- Word Count: Using the `Scanner` class, the program reads each line from the input file and splits it into words using the space delimiter. It then counts the total number of words encountered.
- Robustness: The program handles exceptions using `throws Exception` to ensure robustness in case of file-related errors.
- Flexibility: The program is flexible and can be easily modified or integrated into other applications that require word counting functionality.
  
Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler.
3. Ensure you have a text file named "nadim.txt" or replace it with the desired input file.
4. Run the compiled Java program.
5. The program will output the total word count from the input text file.
